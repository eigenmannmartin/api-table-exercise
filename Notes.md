- normalizr.js is overkill in this scenario
- the only selector "postsSelector" could be memoized
- it is overkill to use ramda in this project (project is way to small)
- I never used semantic UI before - but it looks very promising
- In practice we would redesign the api in a way where we have a better control over what fields it delivers (e.g. give us the number of comments, inline the userName,...)
- It is not "pretty" - but that was not the task
- generally we could cleanup this code - but it really depends on the coding style you already have
- I did not use PropTypes -> Typescript is much better in handling that anyway (You could also use FlowType if you really want to)
- I did not use React-Intl
- This will not work for server side rendered applications
- I have no tests
- you can visit a live deployment here: api-table-excercice.eigenmannmartin.ch
- the error "componentWillMount has been renamed, and is not recommended for use." are semantic-ui errors -> https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/issues/3741
